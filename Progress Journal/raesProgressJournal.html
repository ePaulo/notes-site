        Today, I am breaking my coding strike. I've been on vacation, and when I came back it was hard to code. Today I will become passionate again. I am working on finishing a 
        liking feature on my compliments project. I need it to sync with firebase. I am thinking of using the firebase keys for the compliment to associate them appropriately.

        Today I am feeling overwelmed but excited. I don't want to work, I want to code. I am joining a course that will review the modules (one per week). We are starting with 
        module one today. I am overwelmed with the  lack of desire I have to do the learning portion, and instead wanting to fix my broken projects. I want to fix my notes site,
        which is not displaying the content since I moved each section to separate html files and can't get them to show up on the main html file. I've been told it's not possible
        to place html files within eachother. I am thinking of using .innerhtml but I am sure it won't work. I also need to fix the lists app. I was creating a way to add numbers,
        and it would add them together, including negatives, but now that I'm separating the lists I am rethinking how I'll do that. I think I will have a separate input section for
        the numbers. I was unable to fix the liking feature on the compliments app. I could not get it to update on firebase. I also realized I could have merged the lists in firebase,
        so I might want to refactor the whole app. All and all I am pretty overwhelmed.
